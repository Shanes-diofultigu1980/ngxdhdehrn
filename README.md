OMG, so just 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘦𝘥 Bank of Dave 2: The Loan Ranger, and I'm like half-laughing, half-snoozing. 🤣 Seriously can't believe they made a sequel to that  . Dave's back at it, fighting the big banks like some financial Robin Hood. You'd think they’d run outta ideas, but nah, they double down.

I mean, the whole plot is kinda funny, but mostly, it's like, come on, how's dude still not in jail for loaning money like that? Reality check, please! Anyway, caught myself thinking, should 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   before talking trash, but nah, this 𝘴𝘵𝘳𝘦𝘢𝘮 was good enough. 🤷‍♀️

The characters. Hahaha, where do I even start? Love how they tried adding that one dude who’s like way too obvious comic relief, but hey, it works sometimes! Dave’s still all genuine and heart-of-gold, ya know what I mean? Kinda feels like those dog videos where the dogs are trying to save other dogs from all around the world. Pure, but like, come on, really??

> There was this moment when Dave pulled some insane financial gymnastics that made no sense, not even the unicorn kind that makes you go, Wow! More like, Did that just happen? 😂 

Pretty sure there's some deep life lesson in there somewhere but I was mostly eating popcorn, half zoning in and zoning out. Next time, maybe coffee before 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 the  , right? Anyway, makes me kinda wanna help out more in the community, like pro bono work at the clinic or something. There's this one bit where he talks to his hometown and seriously, those speeches, man. Who writes that??

Just picture me laughing and half-yawning like, yeah okay Dave, save the world, go for it!

Honestly, if they make a third one, I'm in, snuggled on my couch, snacks ready. You gotta give it to them, it’s got the vibes, and maybe—just maybe—it teaches us a lil’ about sticking it to the man. Or maybe it just teaches us that people still love a good comeback story. Who even knows?
